This script is a Python-based SQL injection checker that scans a list of URLs to identify possible SQL injection vulnerabilities. The script reads URLs from a file and checks them using different payloads and proxies to bypass security measures. If an SQL injection vulnerability is found, the script reports the URL as potentially SQL injectable.

Here's a summary of the script's main features:
    1. It reads a list of URLs from a file provided as a command-line argument.
    
    2. It uses a list of proxies from a file to rotate through during the checking process.
    
    3. It reads payloads and SQL error patterns from separate files.
   
    4. It uses multithreading to perform concurrent URL checks.
    
    5. It adds a random delay between requests to avoid being blocked.
    
    6. It saves the potentially SQL injectable URLs to an output file.

The script uses several command-line arguments to customize its behavior:
    
    • --urls: Path to the file containing URLs to check (default: urls.txt)
    
    • --proxies: Path to the file containing proxies to use (default: proxies.txt)
    
    • --timeout: Request timeout in seconds (default: 10)
    
    • --output: Output file for saving SQL injectable URLs (default: result.txt)
    
    • --threads: Number of concurrent threads to use (default: 50)
    
    • --min_delay: Minimum delay between requests in seconds (default: 1.0)
    
    • --max_delay: Maximum delay between requests in seconds (default: 3.0)

To run the script, you need to have Python 3 installed and the following dependencies:
    
    • requests
    
    • colorama
    
    • tqdm

Make sure to create the required input files (URLs, proxies, payloads, and SQL patterns) before running the script. To run the script, save it to a file (e.g., sql_injection_checker.py) and execute it from the command line:

<python sql_injection_checker.py --urls urls.txt --proxies proxies.txt --output result.txt>
    
This command will read URLs from urls.txt, use proxies from proxies.txt, and save the potentially SQL injectable URLs to result.txt.
