Here are a few suggestions to improve the script:

Error handling and logging:
Consider using Python's built-in logging module instead of print statements for better control over the logging output. This allows you to control the log level, format, and destination (file, console, etc.).

Customizable timeouts and delays:
Allow users to specify custom timeouts and delays between requests through command-line arguments or a configuration file. This can help optimize the performance based on the user's needs and available resources.

Validate command-line arguments:
Add validation for command-line arguments, such as checking if the provided files exist and if the number of threads is within a reasonable range.

Proxy rotation strategy:
Currently, the script selects a random proxy for each request. You could consider implementing different proxy rotation strategies, such as using a round-robin approach or prioritizing proxies based on their response times.

User-Agent rotation:
To further avoid being detected and blocked by target websites, consider using a library like fake_useragent to generate and rotate user agents for requests.

Modularization:
Separate the code into different modules (files) based on functionality, such as a module for handling proxies, one for processing URLs, and another for the main script. This will improve code organization and make it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.

Use a configuration file:
Consider using a configuration file (e.g., JSON, YAML, or INI format) to store settings like file paths, timeouts, and other options. This can make it easier for users to customize the tool without modifying the source code.

Add support for other SQL injection detection techniques:
The current script relies on detecting SQL error patterns in the response content. Consider adding support for other detection techniques, such as time-based or boolean-based SQL injection checks, to improve the tool's accuracy.

Progress report:
Provide a periodic summary of the progress, including the number of URLs checked, the number of potentially injectable URLs found, and the time elapsed. This can be helpful for users to gauge the progress of the tool, especially when processing a large number of URLs.

Unit tests and documentation:
Add unit tests for the various functions and classes to ensure their correctness and facilitate future code changes. Also, consider writing comprehensive documentation for the tool, including usage instructions, examples, and explanations of the various options and features.
